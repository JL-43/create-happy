				I sexually Identify as an Attack Helicopter. Ever since I was a
				boy I dreamed of soaring over the oilfields dropping hot sticky
				loads on disgusting foreigners. People say to me that a person
				being a helicopter is Impossible and I'm *** retarded but I
				don't care, I'm beautiful. I'm having a plastic surgeon install
				rotary blades, 30 mm cannons and AMG-114 Hellfire missiles on my
				body. From now on I want you guys to call me "Apache" and
				respect my right to kill from above and kill needlessly. If you
				can't accept me you're a heliphobe and need to check your
				vehicle privilege. Thank you for being so understanding.
